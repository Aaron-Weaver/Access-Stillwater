# Access-Stillwater
Android app for Oklahoma State University app competition.

AccessStillwater is a handy tool to help those who have disabilities to seek out and review local businesses 
based on their ability to accommodate with any number of physical handicaps.

As I look back on this code, I'm not too crazy about its quality, but I like to keep a record of all my stuff, good or bad.
